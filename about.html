<p2><ul><b>About Online Examination System:</b>
Success is all about taking new initiatives. I started developing online Examination project in the year 2022. At the moment, 
I was provided training and guidance by <b>Mr.Vilas Gaikwad Sir</b>. All credit goes to him. Meanwhile, I thought, why not to spread my knowledge to the world. 
So I started developing this on Html, css and java using the the bootstrap. 
I told some of my classmates helped me in programs into the HTML files. He managed to do with project report and all the files, I added some description about the page and put it on the website.After that, I added php.
</ul></p2>

<p2><ul><b>Why Online Examination System Name:</b>

I searched a lot of good names on the web, but all were registered. Since I am in learning mode, i choosed to use this. Thankfully, It was not registered. So,this is localhost. In my opinion, name doesn't matter too much, work matters a lot. 
I thought, if I could work better to the existing site, it will be famous one day. </ul></p2><br>

<p2><ul><b>About Me:</b>

What to say about myself, I don't know. I am a simple guy from childhood, keen to learn new things and implement new ideas. Never worried about what I don't have. 
What I have is the best thing, The Best Teachers of CSMSS Aurangabad....!</ul></p2><br>
